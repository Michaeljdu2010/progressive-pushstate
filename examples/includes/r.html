    The aim is to defeat endless waves of robots, rescue surviving

    <p>Robotron is a 2D <a href=

    set in the year 2084 in a fictional world where robots
    ("Robotrons") have taken control of the world and eradicated
    most of the human race. The main protagonist is a nameless

    <p>The game uses a two-joystick control scheme; the left
    joystick controls the on-screen character's movement, while the
    right controls the direction the character's weapon fires. Both
    joysticks allow for an input direction in one of eight ways.
    Each <a href="/wiki/Level_(video_games)" class="mw-redirect"
    title="Level (video games)">level</a>, referred to as a "wave",
    is a single screen populated with a large number of various
    enemy robots and obstacles; types include invincible giants to
    robots that continually manufacture other robots that shoot the
    protagonist. Coming into contact with an enemy, projectile, or
    obstacle costs the player one life, but extra lives can be
    earned at certain point totals. Waves also include human family
    members who can be rescued to score additional points, but
    certain robots can either kill them or turn them into enemies.
    Destroying all vulnerable robots allows the player to progress
    to the next wave; the cycle continues until all reserve lives
    are lost.<sup id="cite_ref-Fever-1_1-1" class=
