<div class="copy">
	<p>
		This demo will show how progressive pushstate works.  With it, you can
		have links and forms change the state of the page via <a href="">the HTML5
		History API's state object</a>.  This is done by taking all CGI variables
		inside a link or form and using them to change the state of the page via
		JavaScript instead of going back to the server to load a different page.
		Furthermore, if the URL of this resultant page is shared via email or
		social media, the web server can parse the query string and render the page's
		state on the server, thereby decreasing rendering time at page load time
		(which is useful if the page is very JavaScript heavy and page load takes
		a while)
	</p>

	<p>
		To illustrate the point, choose any of the menu items in the header of
		this page.  The content will be loaded via Ajax and the URL changes. Also
		note the neat animation that happens when the page changes state &mdash;
		this is impossible to do if reloading the whole page from the server.
